"""Regression tests for issue #30963 — partial-stream stub finish_reason.

Pins the contract:

- text-only partial stream → stub.finish_reason == "length" so the
  conversation loop's existing length-continuation path can keep the
  agent moving against an unfinished goal.
- partial mid-tool-call → stub.finish_reason == "length" so the loop
  triggers continuation machinery with targeted chunking guidance
  instead of ending the turn immediately.
- conversation_loop's length-continuation prompt distinguishes a real
  output-length truncation from a partial-stream-stub network error
  via response.id.
