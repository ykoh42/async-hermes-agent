"""Tests for the shared MCP agent-tool refresh helper and discovery-wait bound.

``refresh_agent_mcp_tools`` is the single rebuild path used by the TUI
``reload.mcp`` RPC, the gateway reload, and the late-binding refresh thread —
so a slow MCP server that connects after the agent's one-time tool snapshot is
picked up everywhere identically.  These assert the *contracts* those callers
rely on (name-based diff, in-place mutation, agent-scoped filtering) rather than
freezing any particular tool list.
